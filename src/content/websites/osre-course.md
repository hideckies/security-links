title: OFFENSIVE SECURITY & REVERSE ENGINEERING (OSRE) Course
description: This repository is for the Offensive Security and Reverse Engineering Offensive Software Exploitation Course I used to teaching at Champlain College and currently sharing it for free online (check the YouTube channel for the recordings). Most of the slidenotes I used, are already shared on HTID Course, but the labs were fully created by myself. I used publicly available resources and software to explain each of the weakneses covered, so there is nothing here that you cannot find online.
