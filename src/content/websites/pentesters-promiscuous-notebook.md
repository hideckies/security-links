title: Pentester's Promiscuous Notebook
description: I'm snovvcrash and I do ethical penetration testing, red teaming, offensive tooling developement and cybersecurity researching. This is a GitBook of mine whose purpose is keeping my pentest notes on hand. It's far from being perfect in terms of organization (that's why I call it "promiscuous") and, basically, I'm logging it for myself, but it turned out that hosting it online makes it most convenient to access. So, if you find it handy too, feel free to use it... responsibly, of course!
