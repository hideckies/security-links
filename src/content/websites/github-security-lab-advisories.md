title: GitHub Security Lab Advisories
description: GitHub Security Lab researchers find vulnerabilities in key, widely-used open source projects. We then coordinate the disclosure of those vulnerabilities to security teams at those projects. We only publish vulnerabilities here after theyâ€™ve been announced by the affected projects' development teams and patches are available. See our disclosure policy below for more information.
