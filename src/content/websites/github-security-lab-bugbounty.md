title: GitHub Security Lab Bug Bounty
description: The CodeQL Bug Bounty program operated by the GitHub Security Lab aims at scaling the security research communityâ€™s work across open source projects. The All For One protects against future vulnerabilities by coding and eradicating a pattern, while the Bug Slayer fixes existing occurrences of this pattern. A bounty hunter can apply to both programs sequentially to maximize their positive impact on open source projects, and their gain.
