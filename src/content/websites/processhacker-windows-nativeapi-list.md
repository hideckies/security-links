title: Process Hacker Windows Native API List
description: This collection of Native API header files has been maintained since 2009 for the Process Hacker project, and is the most up-to-date set of Native API definitions that we know of. We have gathered these definitions from official Microsoft header files and symbol files, as well as a lot of reverse engineering and guessing. See phnt.h for more information.
