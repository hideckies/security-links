                <h3>What Is This</h3>
                <p>
                    The OffSec Library is a collection of websites for hackers and offensive security researchers.  
                    I'm a security enthusiast and love looking at websites/blogs about cybersecurity, especially offensive security. So I wanted to create something like a huge library.

                <h3>Why Made This</h3>
                <p>
                    Many people who visit this site probably think, "This is just a collection of links." That's right. The reason I made it is mainly for myself. There are so many sites out there that attract me, so it was unrealistic to list them all in my personal task management tool or add them all to my browser's bookmarks. In addition, I wanted to try something new tools/frameworks such as Astro.js.

                <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>
                    The OffSec Library essentially lists sites without permission from the site owner. If your site is listed here and you want it to be excluded please contact me (see below). I'll exclude it immediately.
